title: Using Hazelcast for PCF

This topic describes how developers use Hazelcast for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

After your PCF operator installs the Hazelcast for PCF tile, it automatically registers itself to the Marketplace. 

Follow these steps to create an instance of the Hazelcast service based on an available plan and bind it to your app. 
The plans available to you are determined by your PCF operator. 
For more information about configuring plans, see [Installing and Configuring Hazelcast for PCF](installing.html).

1. To check availability of Hazelcast for PCF, enter the following command:

    ```
    $ cf marketplace
    ```
    For example, 

    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace 
Getting services from marketplace in org system / space system as admin... 
OK<br>
service         plans                            description

    </pre>

1. Create a file called `hazelcast.json` using this [sample JSON file](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/hazelcast-integration/pcf-integration/hazelcast.json) as a template. 

1. Make the following changes to the file:
    - Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with active Hazelcast Enterprise License or a trial license. For more information, see [License](index.html#license). 
    - Replace all other Hazelcast cluster options as appropriate.

1. To create a cluster, enter the following command:
  
    ```
    $ cf create-service hazelcast PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c hazelcast.json
    ```
    For example, 
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service hazelcast t2.micro micro-cluster -c hazelcast.json
Creating service instance micro-cluster in org system / space system as admin...
OK<br> 
Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service micro-cluster' to check operation status. 
    </pre>

3. To bind the service to your app, enter the following commands:

    ```
    $ cf bind-service MY-APPLICATION SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
    $ cf restage MY-APPLICATION
    ```
    For example,
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service myapp micro-cluster
$ cf restage myapp
    </pre>

4. Start using the Hazelcast in-memory data grid (IMDG). Necessary parameters are passed to your application in
 `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. For more information, see [this sample Spring Boot application](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/pcf-integration)
 for further information.
